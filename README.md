# TS-Animated-Cookie
A cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user's computer by a website. It is used to remember the user's preferences, login information, and other data that the website needs to provide a better user experience. An animated cookie using TypeScript could refer to a web application that utilizes the TypeScript programming language to create an interactive and dynamic cookie that responds to user actions or input. This could be used to enhance the user experience and make the website more engaging and entertaining.

To run the project, make sure to first install the GSAP animation library by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
npm install gsap
This will install GSAP as a dependency in your project and allow you to run the animated cookie project without any issues.
